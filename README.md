# CS320

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The best way to achieve this of course, would be to test the program thoroughly. This is the essentially what was covered throughout the course of this class.
Testing is one of the most important aspects of the SDLC.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Break up what the user wants into requirements and tackle them throughout the software developement lifecycle.

How do I approach designing software?

As I have already mentioned a few times the SDLC is the best approach. At least when it comes to larger projects. Smaller projects like we have worked on in
this course could be completed differently. For example, throughout the assignments in this course I would just take the requirements given to us and compelete
them one at a time as I coded. I would not go through the whole design process as it was not needed.
